This folder contains two Jupyter Notebooks, which plot Figures 2a and 2b in the manuscript. 
- The first notebook, `Fig_2a_AIMD_rearrangements_energy.ipynb`, plots the total energy from a GGA+U AIMD trajectory as a function of time.
- The second notebook, `Fig_2d_HSE06_structural_relaxations_from_AIMD.ipynb`, plots the total energy from a series of structures that were extracted from the AIMD trajectory, and fully relaxed with the HSE06 hybrid DFT functional. 
- Data for this folder is contained in `../Data/Data_kinetics/`
