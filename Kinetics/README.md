## Kinetically possible rearrangements: AIMD
This folder contains two Jupyter Notebooks, which plot Figures 2a and 2b in the manuscript. 
- `Fig_2a_AIMD_rearrangements_energy.ipynb`, plots the total energy from a PBE+U AIMD trajectory as a function of time.
- `Fig_2d_HSE06_structural_relaxations_from_AIMD.ipynb`, plots the total energy from a series of structures that were extracted from the AIMD trajectory, and fully relaxed with the HSE06 hybrid DFT functional.
- Data is contained in `../Data/Data_kinetics`
