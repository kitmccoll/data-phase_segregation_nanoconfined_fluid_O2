## Thermodynamically favoured structures: cluster expansion & Monte Carlo
This folder contains two Jupyter Notebooks, which plots Figures 3a and 3d in the manuscript. 
- `Fig_3a_convex_hull.ipynb`, plots the formation energies for a series of 775 HSE06 calculations of structures along the O<sub>2</sub>–MnO<sub>2</sub>–MnO tie-line.
- `Fig_3d_O_envs.ipynb`, reads two structural files, and plots the frequency of their O–ion local environments. The two structure files are i) the pristine 'ribbon' superstructure and ii) a structure generated from the cluster-expansion driven Monte Carlo simulations. 
- Data is contained in `../Data/Data_thermodynamics/`
