This folder contains two Jupyter Notebooks, which plot Figures 3a and 3d in the manuscript. 
- The first notebook, `Fig_3a_convex_hull.ipynb`, plots a convex hull for 755 structures along the O2 – MnO2 – MnO tie line; two hulls are constructed: one with gas O2 as the endmember, and one as confined O2 as the endmember.
- The second notebook, `Fig_3d_O_envs.ipynb`, plots the coordination environments around O sites in the pristine delithiated structure (with a ribbon superstructure) and a 48000 atom cell obtained from the cluster expansion and Monte Carlo annealing at a composition of Mn0.8O2. 
- Data for this folder is contained in `../Data/Data_thermodyanmics/`
